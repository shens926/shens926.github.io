                <p>When I began my journey as an artist and designer, I thought that I was going to be a graphic designer. However, through my Foundations courses (Design Theory, Color Theory, Drawing I, etc.) I discovered an entire new world of art and
                    design that I had not been exposed to before. I became captivated by design and color theory and soon realized how much more I craved pen, paper, brush, and X-Acto knife over the computer. I have not ditched graphic design completely;
                    rather, I am combining my design experience with my love for studio art to become the most well-rounded creative that I can be. Since I decided to switch my major to Studio Art, I have been eagerly absorbing as much knowledge and training
                    as I can. I am extremely thankful for professors and mentors who have invested in me far beyond the classroom and have helped guide me as I figure out what direction is best for my life.</p>
                <p>Although I may have had a&nbsp;bit of a&nbsp;later start, I do have both a strong understanding of design and color theory and an eye for detail. I am, in a sense, a mathematically minded romantic. My motivation for making art is emotional
                    while my approach and execution are logical, planned out, and finished precisely. This past summer, when working out in "the middle of nowhere," WA, I found inspiration in the romantic minutiae&nbsp;that we tend to overlook every day.
                    I want to show this picturesque simplicity through carefully crafted designs using a variety of media. Moving forward, I am excited to grow in the areas I may not be quite as technically strong in yet. I may not be the strongest drawer
                    or the most advanced sculptor, but I am incredibly excited to continue learning and making my presence known in the world of art and design.</p>
